 setitem = stores the key or value

 getitem =get the value by key (key ma kun value xa vanxa)

 removeitem = remove teh key with its value

 clear() = delete every thing

 key(index) = get the key on the given position 

 length = the number of stored items 


 // * NOTE :1) local storage ma keys rw value 2 tai String hunu parxa 
 2) We can use the two JSON METHODS to store  objects in localStorage :
 
 JSON.stringify(object) // * Converts objects to JSON strings 
 JSON.parse(string) // * Converts string to objects(must be a valid JSON )




 The loadTasks() function is responsible for loading tasks from localStorage and recreating them in the DOM 
    when the page is reloaded or reopened.

    If you store tasks in localStorage using saveTasks() and don't have a way to reload them, 
    your task list will always appear empty when you refresh the page—even though the tasks are still saved in localStorage.
  

    Explanation:
localStorage.getItem("tasks")

Retrieve the saved tasks from localStorage. This data is stored as a JSON string.
JSON.parse()

Convert the JSON string back into a JavaScript array of objects. If no tasks are found (e.g., the first time the page loads), it returns an empty array using || [].
savedTasks.forEach()

Loop through each task object in the savedTasks array.
createTaskElement(task.text)

Call the createTaskElement() function to recreate the task in the DOM using the text value.
listcontainer.lastElementChild.classList.add("checked")

If the task’s checked property is true, the "checked" class is added to the last task created (which corresponds to the current task in the loop).



How saveTasks() and loadTasks() Work Together:
saveTasks():

Stores the current list of tasks in localStorage every time you add or remove a task.
loadTasks():

Fetches the stored tasks from localStorage and recreates them on the webpage when the page reloads.
